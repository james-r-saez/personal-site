  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about">I'm a hands-on, analytical full-stack web developer, with a previous background in electrical engineering. I love 
    discovering creative ways to solve a problem and making things easier for people to understand and use. I am 
    tenacious and always strive to find a solution to even the most difficult of dilemmas. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading science and history articles.
